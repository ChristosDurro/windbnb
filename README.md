## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Challenge: Create a small version of Airbnb - Windbnb with given data. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Don’t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see a list of properties
- User story: I can see the property card with a name, rating, apartment type, and super host
- User story: I can open the filter drawer
- User story: I can filter properties by location and number of guests
- User story: I can see the number of filtered items
- User story: I can see pages following given designs

In the search bar you can also type only the name of the city or the country and still get the appartments that correspond to that input without having to press the city, country list appearing on the search bar table. For example typing in "helsinki" only and then pressing the search button will find the appartments that are in helsinki and so on. Same can be applied for countries although, in this project there are only appartments from finland, but if you were to add other countries as well you could use that feature.
